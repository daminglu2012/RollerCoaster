--- Windows / VC++ users --

Open heightmap.sln. This setup assumes that your additional library files reside 
in Y:\libd for debug builds and Y:\lib for release builds. Also assumes that your 
additional include files reside in Y:\include. 

If you are working in the lab and followed the posted instructions that should be 
the case.

If that is not where you unzipped the files from vc-libs-opengl.zip, just edit your
project properties and change the include path under the C/C++ properties and the
lib paths under Link properties.

-- Mingw/Code::Blocks users --

Copy Makefile.mingw to Makefile and use the make command. This makefile assumes that 
you unzipped mingw-libs-opengl.zip under the /cse418 directory if that was not the case
change the assignment to GRAPHICS in the makefile to that path.

If you are using Code::Blocks just create an empty project and use the information from 
Makefile.mingw to set the additional libraries.


-- Linux users --

Makefile.linux should provide you an starting point. If you are using Linux we are
assuming that you know how to setup your environment.
